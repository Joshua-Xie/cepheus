# Environment data file

# IMPORTANT: Whatever data is here will be appended to the overall `build.yaml` that will be located `public` or
# `private` based on the value passed to the intial ./CEPH_UP script

# Things specific to the environment of which you're building. The default is 'vagrant' for a 'local' build.

environment: vagrant

# Domain will be your actual domain in your production cluster
domain: example.com

# Default data center name is `local`
data_center: local

# These can be any data files you want. A normal example is putting your rack data into a separate yaml for each rack
# and then add them here to be included in the final build of `build.yaml` which everything will eventually derive from.
