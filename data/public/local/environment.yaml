# Environment data file

# IMPORTANT: Whatever data is here will be appended to the overall `build.yaml` that will be located `public` or
# `private` based on the value passed to the intial ./CEPH_UP script

# Things specific to the environment of which you're building. The default is 'vagrant' for a 'local' build.

environment: vagrant

# Domain will be your actual domain in your production cluster
domain: example.com

# Default data center name is `local`
data_center: &data_center local

# Can only be `public` or `private`.
location: public

# NICs - Each hardware vendor *may* have different device names. Define them here for the given environment
# Supermicro
## Non-Storage nodes - Assumes 2 devices (could be any size 10Gb, 20Gb, 40Gb) in this scenario
# Non-Storage nodes (clients) do not need a second NIC/Port since only the "public" interface is used
# If you have two then you can bond them if desired
# device1_1U: &device1_1U enp4s0f0
# device2_1U: &device2_1U enp4s0f1d1
## Storage nodes - Assumes 2 devices (could be any size 10Gb, 20Gb, 40Gb) in this scenario
# device1_2U: &device1_2U enp130s0f0
# device2_2U: &device2_2U enp130s0f1d1

## Make sure to check the NIC device names of your hardware and update them here.

## NB: Important - The following device variables are defined here in the environment.yaml file ONLY.
## Other data files can reference `*device1_1U` etc since the final file 'build.yaml' will have these defined in it.
#
# Vagrant
device1_1U: &device1_1U enp0s8
device2_1U: &device2_1U enp0s9
device1_2U: &device1_2U enp0s8
device2_2U: &device2_2U enp0s9
#
## End of device variable naming

# These can be any data files you want. A normal example is putting your rack data into a separate yaml for each rack
# and then add them here to be included in the final build of `build.yaml` which everything will eventually derive from.
